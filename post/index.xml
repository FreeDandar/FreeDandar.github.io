      <title>Seventh Week</title>
      <link>https://freedandar.github.io/post/seventh-week/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 18:51:20 +0300</pubDate>
      <guid>https://freedandar.github.io/post/seventh-week/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-seventh-七-week-is-almost-over&#34;&gt;The seventh 七/❼ week is almost over!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;monday&#34;&gt;Monday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday was purely a Monday and did not represent anything. Right on the maximum weekly Monday. 😑😑😑 In the morning, programming technology, in the afternoon - our favorite subject (hint - OS 🤓).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tuesday&#34;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday we had the last physical education class of this academic year 😔. It&amp;rsquo;s a pity, but nothing, we&amp;rsquo;ll meet next!!! 🤸 We finished all the unfinished standards, completed the tests, heard what we had earned this year (points) and went home in peace 🌎. And yes, it was raining again that day! And not on any other day! Just some kind of attack! The weather hates physical education 😡😡😡😤😤😤&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wednesday&#34;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the whole large friendly group of us attended a practice class on programming technology, as we do every Wednesday. In this practice, we programmed the entire lesson using programming technology. Of course, having previously understood how to program. I just realized that I have never told you what and on what we write!! 🙊 And we write different programs in the high-level programming language C++ (C plus plus). It&amp;rsquo;s a cool language and he&amp;rsquo;s doing well with his memory 😁👍. Here. As the teacher told us, this is the last practical lesson as such. The next classes will be all the test papers 💀💀💀.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;thursday&#34;&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does Thursday even exist? There used to be a matesha, but now there are operating systems. Practical lesson. But not like TP (programming technology), so here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;friday&#34;&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Friday, or rather last Friday, we had our last English class of this academic year. 😢😢😢 There we finished everything that we didn&amp;rsquo;t finish and handed over everything that we didn&amp;rsquo;t finish. But we will miss you, English!!!! 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;saturday&#34;&gt;Saturday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday is now like Friday, and like a real Saturday, and not this is yours. 👍👍👍&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Scientific programming languages</title>
      <link>https://freedandar.github.io/post/sci-langs/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 May 2022 18:17:00 +0300</pubDate>
      <guid>https://freedandar.github.io/post/sci-langs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;this-is-who-who&#34;&gt;This is who (who)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific programming languages, generally speaking, are programming languages that are widely used for computational science and computational mathematics. We will consider scientific programming languages as languages designed and optimized for the use of mathematical formulas and matrices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;examples&#34;&gt;Examples&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the most significant and interesting scientific programming languages (in my subjective opinion), the following languages can be distinguished&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fortran&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MATLAB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Julia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I had experience with the last two myself and I can mention Julia as the newest of the highlighted ones, but the most convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sixth week</title>
      <link>https://freedandar.github.io/post/sixth-week/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 May 2022 17:57:46 +0300</pubDate>
      <guid>https://freedandar.github.io/post/sixth-week/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;sixth-6-6-its-almost-been-a-week&#34;&gt;Sixth (6 (6️⃣)) it&amp;rsquo;s almost been a week!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;monday&#34;&gt;Monday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday was according to the standard &amp;ndash; a morning lecture on TP (Programming Technology 👨‍💻) to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WAKE UP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and a subsequent lecture on&amp;hellip;.. 🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁&amp;hellip; OPERATING SYSTEMS!!!! On operating systems, my fellow students, as usual, told their interesting (no kidding 🤭🤭🤭) reports. I learned a lot of new things, for example, that the slide &amp;ldquo;Thank you for your attention&amp;rdquo; is useless 💀💀💀. And on Friday (last) we didn&amp;rsquo;t have English 😔, so we decided to divide it into pairs and spend them on different days. We decided to hold one of the pairs this Monday. The couple went right after the OS and was cool. There we were preparing for exams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tuesday&#34;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday we had physical education 🦾. Unfortunately, this time we were studying indoors again 🏫. Yes, the weather was not so good again 😞😞😞🤒🤒🤒. But this did not prevent us from being physically active and passing some standards. In general, it was great! 😁😁😁&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wednesday&#34;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, as usual, we had a practice on programming technologies. Last time we wrote a test, so this time we rested. Hahahah, just kidding 😆😆😆. Of course we didn&amp;rsquo;t rest! We worked the whole lesson, diligently memorizing the material and delving into programming technologies. We have gained a lot of new knowledge and skills 🧠🧠🧠🤓🤓🤓.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after practice, we had two other pairs of English. There we wrote a test and spoke English. We know English! 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;thursday&#34;&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday is not a day. There was practice, all the smartest people were there (I wasn&amp;rsquo;t there 😢).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;friday&#34;&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Friday was (probably) the last English of this academic year. We have completed everything that was not completed. They solved everything that they didn&amp;rsquo;t solve. And we also passed a monologue (&lt;em&gt;Monologue (from other Greek. μόνος - one and λόγος — speech) — the speech of the actor, mainly in a dramatic work, turned off from the colloquial communication of the characters and not assuming a direct response, unlike dialogue; speech addressed to listeners or to himself.&lt;/em&gt;). Everything was great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;saturday&#34;&gt;Saturday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday is Arduino, as you remember, but as you remember, we did everything, so Saturday is not Arduino. 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creating presentations</title>
      <link>https://freedandar.github.io/post/presentation-creation/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 May 2022 14:35:16 +0300</pubDate>
      <guid>https://freedandar.github.io/post/presentation-creation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post we will talk about how to create presentations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presentations are created as slides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s better to have more pictures on slides than text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text is bad, there are reports and pieces of paper for the text. The presentation should contain a lot of visual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation is only part of the speech and the speaker must also be good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presentations can be created as in &lt;a href=&#34;https://g.co/kgs/va3vLh&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;WYSIWYG&lt;/a&gt; format, for example PowerPoint, Keynote, Slides, and in the opposite, for example using Markdown (this post is created exactly like this 🤭).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slides should divide information into blocks, and special slides, blocks of information, into chapters.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fifth week</title>
      <link>https://freedandar.github.io/post/fifth-week/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 May 2022 14:21:56 +0300</pubDate>
      <guid>https://freedandar.github.io/post/fifth-week/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-fifth-week-is-almost-over&#34;&gt;The fifth week is almost over!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;monday&#34;&gt;Monday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, after a long absence, we finally resumed lectures on our favorite subjects!!! These are programming technologies and the most favorite &amp;ndash; operating systems ❤️❤️❤️. Throughout the lecture, my fellow students told their reports. I also had a report, but apparently, since it was for the last lesson (which, as we know, did not pass), I was not called for a lesson. 😞😞😞 But it&amp;rsquo;s okay, I told the report to Dmitry Sergeevich at an additional consultation. My report was about command shells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tuesday&#34;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had physical education on Tuesday. The last couple of classes were outside, but the weather was bad that day, so we studied indoors. But it didn&amp;rsquo;t stop us and we still got strength and vitamins 💪💪💪.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wednesday&#34;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Wednesday, as usual, we had a practice in programming technology. But this week, she was unusual 😱😱😱 We had a &lt;strong&gt;TEST&lt;/strong&gt; on it!!! We have been preparing hard for it for days on end and in the end we gave our all to show the result 🤓🤓🤓. Cohesively, the test paper was written coolly!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;thursday&#34;&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday there was a practice on the best subject - Operating systems. There people do laboratory work (probably ¯\_(ツ)_/¯).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;friday&#34;&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday we had English. There we sort of worked with monologues and prepared for the test. Of course, in English 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;saturday&#34;&gt;Saturday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Saturday we would have been doing things with Arduino, as before, but we successfully finished working on all laboratory projects with our cool team.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Markdown Markup Language</title>
      <link>https://freedandar.github.io/post/markdown/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2022 18:00:37 +0300</pubDate>
      <guid>https://freedandar.github.io/post/markdown/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-it&#34;&gt;What is it&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markdown is a markup language used for formatting documents of all types. Today it is one of the most popular languages among programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-does-the-markup-language-mean&#34;&gt;What does the markup language mean&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, a markup language is not a programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markup language is a language that uses tags or symbols to apply styling to content. The most popular markup languages in the world are HTML (which is often falsely attributed to programming languages), XML and Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-to-write-on-it&#34;&gt;How to write on it&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like any language, this language has its own syntax. It is simple enough to understand and consists of a set of special characters that change the appearance of the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; for italics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; for fat content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; for underscores (not always)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; for strikethrough (not always)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; for headers of different levels
&lt;em&gt;All but the last one are placed around the text as format borders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;`-----------------------`

*I write this text in italics*, **this one is just bold**, ***this is both***.

__Here I underlined (but here it&amp;#39;s just bold)__, ~~and here I crossed out~~.
# This is a big headline
## Smaller header
### The title is even smaller
#### Small title

`----------------------`
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;it will look like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-----------------------&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I write this text in italics&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;this one is just bold&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this is both&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here I underlined (but here it&amp;rsquo;s just bold)&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;del&gt;and here I crossed out&lt;/del&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;this-is-a-big-headline&#34;&gt;This is a big headline&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;smaller-header&#34;&gt;Smaller header&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-title-is-even-smaller&#34;&gt;The title is even smaller&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;small-title&#34;&gt;Small title&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;----------------------&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;interesting-fact&#34;&gt;Interesting fact!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of this site is written using Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fourth week</title>
      <link>https://freedandar.github.io/post/fourth-week/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2022 17:47:08 +0300</pubDate>
      <guid>https://freedandar.github.io/post/fourth-week/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-fourth-week-is-almost-over&#34;&gt;The fourth week is almost over!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;monday&#34;&gt;Monday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday there was a holiday - May 9th - Victory Day. Therefore, this day was a weekend. And this means that we had neither a lecture on programming technologies, nor, most importantly, a lecture on &lt;strong&gt;Operating systems&lt;/strong&gt;!!!!! 😱😱😱 This is the second week without these lectures!!!! 💀💀💀 It&amp;rsquo;s generally uncool and very sad. 😔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tuesday&#34;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday was also a day off (although on this day we already have only physical education). On this day I was doing laboratory work on my favorite subject &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operating systems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 😍😍😍. Did both lab work! I really liked them! 👍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wednesday&#34;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday we had a practice on programming technologies. There we studied stacks, FIFO, LIFO and that&amp;rsquo;s it. 😵‍💫 It was difficult, but interesting. 🤓&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;thursday&#34;&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday there was a practice on, as you might have guessed, my favorite subject - Operating systems. People are doing lab work there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;friday&#34;&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday we had English and it was also very cool there. There we studied English and spoke English words. 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧 For example, &amp;ldquo;Hello&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;saturday&#34;&gt;Saturday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, after missing class due to the holidays, there was a lesson in my second favorite subject &lt;em&gt;Computer practice in IT&lt;/em&gt;. 💻 There we did different things with Arduino again. 🤖&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a great week!!! 😁👍&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Version control. Git.</title>
      <link>https://freedandar.github.io/post/git-version-control/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2022 19:12:32 +0300</pubDate>
      <guid>https://freedandar.github.io/post/git-version-control/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-a-git&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s a git?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git is a distributed version control system. It was developed by Linus Torvalds to manage the development of the Linux kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;and-what-is-a-version-control-system&#34;&gt;And what is a version control system?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A version control system is a software that allows you to store multiple versions of the same document and, if necessary, go back to past versions, merge them, track changes, and much more. Thus, the version control system greatly facilitates work both with large projects, in which there are many &amp;ldquo;blocks&amp;rdquo; and modules that are developed separately, and with single files, for example text documents, in which you can return to any version of previously written text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-does-it-work&#34;&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;repository-as-a-project&#34;&gt;Repository as a project&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In git, the &amp;ldquo;project unit&amp;rdquo; is the repository. It&amp;rsquo;s like a kind of directory that stores files, versions and everything related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;branches&#34;&gt;Branches&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In git, there is a concept of &amp;ldquo;branches&amp;rdquo; that divide the entire flow of changes made and the entire project as a whole into different &amp;ldquo;currents&amp;rdquo;. Thus, you can make separate branches for individual innovations, separate pre-release versions (beta versions) and for any other conditional divisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;client-server&#34;&gt;Client-server&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;git is initially installed as a local utility, but it can also be used in conjunction with the server. In this case, local changes will need to be uploaded to the server, which will be a centralized &amp;ldquo;point of truth&amp;rdquo; (i.e., where the most up-to-date version of the project is located). This also gives the advantages of saving data, that in case the local version disappears, the version on the server will serve as a backup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After talking about git as a system, it&amp;rsquo;s worth understanding what benefits it can bring to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think everyone has already identified the main point for themselves that this allows you to control work on something much more flexibly and conveniently. However, let&amp;rsquo;s mention a few more advantages of the git version control system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;general-work&#34;&gt;General work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the scenario of using git together with the server, it opens up the possibility of several users working on one project. In this case, everyone is working on their part of the project, uploads it to the repository and there it is all assembled into a single project. If conflicts arise, they can be resolved in such ways as merge or choosing a priority version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;packaging-of-the-code&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Packaging&amp;rdquo; of the code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using git, it is possible to create so-called &amp;ldquo;packages&amp;rdquo;. This is a &amp;ldquo;assembled&amp;rdquo; project that is distributed as a ready-made version. In the case of some program, it will be an executable file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pipeline-cicd&#34;&gt;Pipeline (CI/CD)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also (most likely in a scenario with a server for git) it is possible to create a so-called development pipeline. I.e., you can configure the rules by which, when certain events trigger (for example, uploading a new commit to the &lt;em&gt;dev&lt;/em&gt; branch), the processing process will be performed. Continuing the example, when loading a new commit (code), all tests will be performed and an attempt will be made to run the program on various operating systems, which will allow you to check the operability of the code and its maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I would like to say that everyone should at least try using git. Believe me, you will like it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Third week</title>
      <link>https://freedandar.github.io/post/third-week/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-week-was-so-cool&#34;&gt;The week was so cool!!!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-really-liked-everything&#34;&gt;I really liked everything!!!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, according to the schedule, we have two remote lectures, but this Monday was a day off due to the holidays. But despite this, at the last lesson, the teacher in one of the subjects told us that there would be classes, despite the fact that it was a day off. However, in the end, there were no classes at the end! (🥺)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, on Tuesday, we had physical education. Everything was great!! 💪🏿&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, at 9 am, the whole group of us were already sitting like a bayonet on a pair of Programming Technology 💻. The couple was very interesting! We studied single-linked and double-linked lists and did tasks. We all succeeded! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday we have practical classes on our favorite subject - Operating Systems! 📀 Everything was very cool there!!! (probably)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, some students also have additional classes in foreign languages. I have English and this week it was remote. English is a very cool subject and language! 🇬🇧 London is the capital of Great Britain. 🇬🇧&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday (you won&amp;rsquo;t believe it, we study on Saturdays!!! 😱🤯🙊) we had laboratory classes on Computer practice in IT. There we worked with arduino, connected all sorts of wires and sensors to it. 🖲 It was cool!!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Welcome to Wowchemy, the website builder for Hugo</title>
      <link>https://freedandar.github.io/post/getting-started/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs. It&amp;rsquo;s a good platform for anyone looking to take control of their data and online identity whilst having the convenience to start off with a &lt;strong&gt;no-code solution (write in Markdown and customize with YAML parameters)&lt;/strong&gt; and having &lt;strong&gt;flexibility to later add even deeper personalization with HTML and CSS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can work with all your favourite tools and apps with hundreds of plugins and integrations to speed up your workflows, interact with your readers, and much more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
















&lt;figure  id=&#34;figure-the-template-is-mobile-first-with-a-responsive-design-to-ensure-that-your-site-looks-stunning-on-every-device&#34;&gt;
